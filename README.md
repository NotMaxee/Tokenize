# Tokenize

Tokenize is a token generator for virtual tabletops like Foundry VTT or Roll20.
It works entirely in your browser and lets you turn any image supported by your
browser into a neat `512x512px` resolution token.

If you want to give Tokenize as try, you can check out a live demo
[here](https://notmaxee.github.io/Tokenize/). Go make some tokens!

## Features

Here's a list of the things Tokenize does:

* Generate neat tokens with a transparent border.
* Generate multiple tokens at once by selecting more than one image.
* Download generate tokens one by one or in a single ZIP file.
* Manually adjust the position and zoom of token art.
* Set a default background colour for transparent images.
* Make you look pretty snazzy.

And here's a few things it doesn't (currently) do:

* Remember your settings.
* Allow you to set a custom background image for transparent tokens.
* Allow you to pick from different token borders.
* Mobile support somewhat works, but I recommend against it.
* Improve your rolls.
